By the end of this unit, you will be able to _manipulate strings, lists, dicts, and combinations thereof in Python. These are the building blocks of most Python code, so mastery of them is essential_.

## Unit overview

This unit is best completed with a terminal running an online Python 3 REPL, IPYTHON in your terminal, or a Juptyer Notebook side by side with Learn so you can better see the results of the statements and functions you write to try to solve the problems.
